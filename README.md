# Logistic-Regression-ML
This repository features an implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm, a widely used statistical model for binary classification tasks.

## Features:

Implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification.

Step-by-step code with detailed comments for better understanding.

Gradient descent-based optimization for parameter estimation.

Includes a sample dataset for demonstration.

Visualization of decision boundaries and performance metrics (if applicable).

Beginner-friendly for those learning machine learning concepts.

## Technologies Used:

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib (if visualization is included)

Scikit-learn (optional, for comparisons or dataset utilities)

## Applications:

Binary classification tasks such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, etc.

Understanding logistic regression as a probabilistic model.

Building a foundation for more advanced machine learning models.
